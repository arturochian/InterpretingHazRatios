Recently the Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) model has become a popular tool for political scientists for examining cross-unit cross-time data. However, as \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{Keele2010}, and \cite{Hern'an2010} have pointed out many researchers using EHA have inadequately addressed issues of model misspecification. This is unfortunate because causes of model misspecification, particularly non-linearity and time-varying effects may be substantively meaningful for political scientists. Ignoring them means that researchers are not only presenting biased estimates, but also not using EHA to its full potential. For example, focusing on time averaged effects ignores EHA's ability to examine how time-period specific events--such as global shocks or the promotion of new policy ideas--interact with traditional covariates. In this article I advocate a strategy for political scientists using Cox PH models to address these issues. The computational tools for implementing this strategy are currently lacking. So I introduce a new R package--\emph{simPH}--that includes tools for graphically exploring time-varying and non-linear Cox PH estimates along with estimation uncertainty. I illustrate \emph{simPH}'s capabilities by replicating results from recent political science research.

Recent articles in \emph{Political Analysis} have highlighted two frequently overlooked sources of model misspecification and misinterpretation in the popular Cox Proportional Hazard (PH) model \citep{cox1972}. \cite{Licht2011} discusses how to model and interpret time-varying covariate effects that violate the proportional hazards assumption. \cite{Keele2010} cautions that violations of the proportional hazards assumption can also be caused by forms of model misspecification other than  time-varying effects, such as un-modeled nonlinear relationships. He argues that political scientists rarely test for this possibility. In addition, \cite{Hern'an2010} recently published a short article in \emph{Epidemiology} highlighting how a study's time-period can bias parameter estimates. Examining these types of biases is rarely done in political science research.

The Cox PH model and Event History Analysis (EHA) in general is increasingly being used to address political science questions. A small sample of recent studies using Cox PH and EHA includes: \cite{Aleman2011, BuenodeMesquita1999, brooks2005, Gandrud2012, Gates2006, Golub2007, Jordana2005, Mccubbins2009, Neumayer2002, Simmons2006}. As the Cox PH model has become more prevalent in political science we need better strategies and tools for addressing the issues that \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{Keele2010}, and \cite{Hern'an2010} identify.

My aim in this paper is to lay out a strategy and corresponding computational tools for addressing these problems. First, I briefly summarize Licht, Keele, and Hern\'{a}n's arguments. Second, I combine them together into a single strategy for political scientists using Cox PH models. Graphically presenting results can be a useful way of addressing these issues so I introduce a new R \citep{RLanguage} package--\emph{simPH} \citep{R-simPH}--that includes tools for graphically exploring time-varying and non-linear Cox PH estimates along with corresponding estimation uncertainty. I illustrate \emph{simPH}'s capabilities by replicating results from recent political science research.

%%%%%% Section: Common issues
\section{Common issues in analyses with Cox PH models}

In this paper I focus on one of the more commonly used EHA models in political science, the Cox Proportional Hazard Model \citet{cox1972}.\footnote{See \cite[47]{boxsteffensmeier2004} for a discussion of the model's popularity in political science. In general my conclusions also apply to Fine and Gray's \citeyearpar{Fine1999} Competing Risks Model which is a Cox PH analogue for competing risks EHA.} The Cox PH is a semi-parametric EHA model that allows researchers to examine how specified factors influence the rate of a particular event happening--e.g. a policy is adopted, a government falls, or a war breaks out--at a particular point in time given that the event has not already occurred.

This rate is commonly referred to as the hazard rate ($h_{i}(t)$).\footnote{It is given formally by: $h_{i}(t) = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\mathrm{Pr}(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \leq t)}{\Delta t}$, where $T$ is the time that an event occurred over the interval $[t,\:\Delta t]$.} The hazard rate for unit $i$ at time $t$ is estimated with the Cox PH model using: 
%
\begin{equation}
    h(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{(\mathbf{\beta X}_{i})},
\end{equation}
%
where $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard, i.e. the instantaneous rate of a transition at time $t$ when all of the covariates are zero. $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of coefficients and $\mathbf{X}_{i}$ is the vector of covariates for unit $i$.

We are usually interested in how a covariate changes the rate of an event happening. For example, does having a majoritarian electoral system increase the probability of a country adopting a given policy? In general researchers have tried to answer these questions by looking at the Cox PH coefficient estimates $\beta$.\footnote{Like logistic regression, the coefficient is more easily interpreted if we examine its exponent $\exp(\beta)$, i.e. the hazard ratio (HR). Using the HR we can find the predicted percentage change in the hazard rate when we compare two values of a given variable. To find how the effect on the hazard rate of some value $X_{1}$ compared to $X_{2}$ with a coefficient $\beta$ we use the following formula from \citet[60]{boxsteffensmeier2004}: $\%\triangle h(t) = \left[\frac{\mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{1})} - \mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{2})}} {\mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{2})}}\right].$} However, only examining single coefficients can lead to significant model misspecification and erroneous substantive interpretation of Cox PH results.

\subsection{Non-proportional hazards \& Time-varying effects}

One of the most important sources of estimation bias in Cox PH models discussed at length by \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{BoxSteffensmeier2001}, and \cite{boxsteffensmeier2004} is a violation of the proportional hazards assumption (PHA). The PHA is that the hazards of two units experiencing an event are proportional to one another and that this relationship is constant overtime. Formally, for the PHA to hold the hazard for units $j$ and $l$ must be:\footnote{This is also the equation for the hazard ratio between $X_{j}$ and $X_{l}$.}
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{h_{j}(t)}{h_{l}(t)} = \mathrm{e}^{\beta\prime(X_{j} - X_{l})}.
\end{equation}
%
If the PHA is violated and measures are not taken to correct for the violation, then researchers may create biased parameter estimates and statistical tests with lower power \citep{Therneau1990,Keele2010}. Beyond these statistical problems, not adjusting for violations of the PHA can obscure phenomenon that political researchers are interested in finding.

\cite{Licht2011} identifies a number of important political science theories that actually lead us to expect that the PHA will be violated. She argues that ``the nature of the political processes of learning, institutionalization, strategic developments, and information transmission \ldots are likely to produce frequent violations of the PHA'' \citeyearpar[228]{Licht2011}. In particular, building on \cite{Finnemore1998} and \cite{blyth1997} researchers have attempted to empirically examine how ideas may affect policy change and diffusion relative to geopolitical and domestic political and economic factors, among others. An important empirically observable difference between these types of theories is how they predict the effects of specific factors \emph{ change over time relative to others}.\footnote{Note that the effects of variables in Cox PH can change overtime without violating the PHA via a change in the baseline hazard. We will look at this issue in more detail later in this section.} For example, the effect of norms and ideational diffusion mechanisms \citep[see][]{Yee1996} are predicted to strengthen overtime. Whereas the effect of most domestic political and economic and geopolitical factors are expected to have a constant or perhaps decreasing effect overtime \citep[228]{Licht2011}. It is likely that more than one of these approaches has an effect on any given political event of interest. Therefore we should expect that some of our covariates will violate the PHA because their effects on the hazard of an event change non-proportionally over time relative to one another. Properly modeling how covariate effects change overtime is crucial for 	adequately testing our hypotheses. 

There are a number of widely used tests to examine whether or not the PHA is violated. See \cite{Grambsch1994}, \cite{BoxSteffensmeier2001}, and \cite{boxsteffensmeier2004} for discussions of various methods of testing the PHA.\footnote{Many common software packages implement versions of these tests. R's \emph{survival} package \citep{R-survival} implements Grambsch and Therneau's \citeyearpar{Grambsch1994} modified Schoenfeld residuals test. This is done with the \texttt{cox.zph} command.} If a covariate is determined to violate the PHA, Box-Steffensmeier and co-authors \citep[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2003,boxsteffensmeier2004} suggest directly modeling the relationship between the variable and time. This usually entails including an interaction between the variable and some function of time such as the natural logarithm or some exponent.\footnote{The decision to use a particular functional form should be guided by theory and will likely also be influenced by findings in the data.} If $f(t)$ is some function of time then a simple Cox PH model estimating the hazard rate for unit $i$ with one time-interaction is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
	h_{i}(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{(\beta_{1}X_{i} + \beta_{2}f(t)X_{i})}.
\end{equation}

Like any other interaction effect \cite[see][]{Brambor2006} extra care should be taken when interpreting the $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ parameter estimates. We cannot simply interpret the effect by looking at $\beta_{1}$ or $\beta_{2}$ in isolation. They need to be combined. Licht argues that post-estimation simulation techniques should be employed to substantively interpret these combined coefficients and the uncertainty surrounding them. 

She describes two methods of calculating the combined effect of a time interaction in ways that are relatively easy to interpret: (a) first differences and (b) relative hazards. A first difference is the percentage change in the hazard rate at time ($t$) between two given values of $X$:
%
\begin{equation}
	\%\triangle h_{i}(t) = (e^{(X_{j} - X_{l})(\beta_{1} + \beta{2}f(t))} - 1) * 100.
\end{equation}
% 
Relative hazards\footnote{The term was advanced by \cite{Golub2007}.} are given by:
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{h_{j}(t)}{h_{l}(t)} = \mathrm{e}^{X_{j}(\beta_{1} + \beta_{2}f(t))},
\end{equation}
%
In this situation the covariate $X_{l}$ is 0. Relative hazards represent the change in the hazard when $X$ is ``switched on'' as it would be when comparing an European Union member to a non-member, for example.

Relative hazards are particularly useful for binary variables because they reflect the change in the hazards from $X = 0$ to $X = 1$. The first difference can be more useful for continuous variables as changes in $X$ from 0 to 1 may be inconsequential or even impossible when we are looking at, for example, the effect of GDP per Capita on an event. In these cases the first difference will be more appropriate. Nonetheless, the choice between relative hazards and first differences can be cosmetic. They are virtually the same if $X_{j} - X_{l} = 1$.\footnote{Of course first differences are percentage changes, so are 100 times larger.}

Following \cite{King2000}, Licht advocates post-estimation simulation techniques for making it easy to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the first difference and relative hazards estimates. In both cases we first find the the parameter estimates for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ and $\hat{\beta_{2}}$ from a Cox PH model as well as the variance matrix $\hat{V}(\hat{\beta})$. Second, we draw $n$ values of $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ from the multivariate normal distribution given by $\hat{\beta} \sim N(\hat{\beta}, \hat{V}(\hat{\beta}))$. Third, we use these simulated values to calculate either the first difference or relative hazard for a range of times $T = [t_{1}\ldots t_{T}]$ as well as specified values of $X_{j}$ and $X_{l}$ (as appropriate). Finally, we can plot the results. Using this simulation technique allows us to estimate the full time-varying effect, how it changes over time, substantively asses the effect, and show the uncertainty surrounding our estimates.
 
\subsection{Nonlinear Effects}

Time-varying coefficient effects are not the only cause of PHA violations. Building on \cite{Grambsch1994} and \cite{Therneau2000}, \cite{Keele2010}\footnote{See also \cite{Keele2008} chapter 6.} points out that common diagnostic tests will also indicate PHA violations if the model is misspecified for other reasons. Omitting an important covariate, using a proportional hazards model even if another EHA model is more appropriate, or including a covariate as linear when its effect is actually nonlinear can lead to significant PHA tests indicating a violation of the assumption. 

Because of this Keele suggests that \emph{before} testing the PHA we should (a) try to make sure that we are not omitting important variables and (b) find the appropriate functional form for the covariates, typically using either polynomials or splines.\footnote{See \cite{Keele2008} for a review of different spline types.} He demonstrates this in replication studies by adding splines to models using a Wald test to examine if the splines have a better fit than their linear counterparts.\footnote{He also suggests that likelihood ratio tests can be used \citep[195]{Keele2010}.} Many studies using Cox PH models did not test for nonlinearity, but instead jumped straight to testing the PHA, including time-interactions when it was violated. As Keele \citeyearpar{Keele2010} demonstrates ascribing a time-varying effect to a covariate when in fact the effect varies not over time, but nonlinearly over values of the covariate can have major implications for substantive interpretation of results from Cox PH models.

After omitted variables and nonlinearities have been addressed, then (c) we should test the PHA. If it is violated we can add time interactions as before. If after doing all of these steps non-proportional hazards are still present then (d) he suggests we should look for an EHA model, such as the log-logistic model--that does not assume proportional hazards.

\subsection{Time-period biases}

Finally, we should avoid interpreting estimated effects, regardless of whether the effects are non-linear, time-varying, or not, without reference to time. \cite{Hern'an2010} highlights two problems with interpreting EHA results without reference to time. These are: (a) hazard ratios are averaged over the studies' observation periods and (b) period-specific results have a ``built-in selection-bias". 

Coefficient estimates and hazard ratios--i.e. exponentiated Cox PH coefficients--are the estimated effects of variables on the hazard rate averaged over a study's particular observation period. Equation 2 gives us a variable's time-averaged hazard ratio. As with any mean value, HRs may in fact be large at one point in the study and then small in another. Presenting just time-averaged HRs does not reveal these trends. We have already seen how effects may vary non-proportionally over time and how finding and graphing first differences or relative hazards estimated from explicitly modeled time interactions is an important way of overcoming model misspecification and misinterpretation. Importantly, this problem can also arise \emph{even if the proportional hazards assumption is not violated}. In either case it can be important to carefully consider how time-periods may be affecting results. 

Researchers often do not consider how a study's observation period can bias hazards over time. Estimates can be influenced by a study's duration. I'll refer to this as Study Duration Selection Bias (SDSB). Similarly, though not mentioned by Hern\'{a}n's epidemiologically oriented study, hazard rates can be affected by events common to all units in specific historical time-periods. I'll call this Time-period Specific Bias (TPSB). Let's look at how these biases might manifest themselves in political science data and what we can do about them.

\paragraph{Study Duration Selection Bias}

If effects estimated from Cox PH models can change at each point in time, then a study's specific observation period can effect its results. For example, imagine that we are interested in how long it takes countries to adopt a policy $P$. We create an Cox PH model with various independent variables $X$. One of the variables is level of democracy. We estimate the model using twenty years worth of data. Imagine that the averaged hazard ratio for democracy from this model is positive--higher democracy scores increase the hazard of adopting policy $P$. We find that the variable violates the PHA, but not because it has a nonlinear effect. So we reestimate the model with a time interaction. When we plot the first difference over time we find that in the first ten years of the observation period the HR is positive. Then it becomes weakly negative for the last decade. 

What causal story could explain this? SDSB may be at work. There could be a proportion of countries in our sample that are more likely to adopt policy $P$ when they also have a high level of democracy, because democracy level is interacting with some unobserved factor $Z$ shared by these countries to produce a common effect $C$. Using epidemiological terminology, these countries are more `susceptible'. Over the course of the observation period, the more susceptible countries adopt policy $P$ at a higher rate than countries that just have high values of democracy. After the susceptible countries exit the risk set,\footnote{The risk set at any point in time is the set of units that have not experienced the event of interest before that time.} we are left with a sample of less susceptible countries. Democracy in the absence of $Z$ may actually have a slight negative causal effect, which we observe after the susceptible countries drop out of our sample. 

SDSB is a particular problem in cohort studies, i.e. those that follow one group of subjects that drop out of the risk set when they experience the event of interest. Studies of national level policy choices are an example. 

\paragraph{Time-period Specific Bias} 

In many cross-country cross-time studies data is taken from specific historical time periods. This can create an additional cause of time-varying effects that is also often not given much attention: time-period specific bias. As should be obvious, not all historical time-periods are the same. For example, in certain time periods particular ideas are heavily prompted by international organizations while in other periods different, even conflicting ideas are advanced. Many or all countries could be exposed to the same ideas at the same time \citep[see][]{Gandrud2012}. These common time-period specific factors $Z$ may interact with some observed variable $x$ to change the hazard of a country adopting a given policy. As the common factor appears and dissipates or is replaced with a different factor with a different interactive effect with $x$ it will make it seem as though $x$ has a time-varying effect. In essence a combined modeled time interaction $\beta_{1}X_{i} + \beta_{2}f(t)X_{i}$ is actually just a proxy for the real interaction $\beta_{1}X_{i} + \beta_{2}Z{i} +\beta_{3}X_{i}Z_{i}$, where $Z$ is highly correlated with time. Researchers therefore need to carefully consider if common time-period specific factors are interacting with a variable $x$ causing it to appear to have a time-varying effect. 

In some cases, however, standard tests for non-proportional hazards will not indicate a time-varying effect even if there are time-period specific common factors. For example any country adopting a given policy may only happen after some common event occurs, i.e. the idea for the policy is created and promoted. In these cases we will not observe a violation of the PHA. This is because standard tests of non-proportional hazards tend to use Shoenfeld residuals \citep[see][]{Grambsch1994}, which are calculated for each variable $x$ when a unit is observed to have an event \citep[181]{Kleinbaum2011}. If no or very few units have an event before another particular time-period specific event happens then times before this event will essentially be ignored by the PHA test. Yet it would be wrong to assume that the is no time-varying effect. In fact, if a variable is found to have a significant and meaningfully sized effect over the period when events do occur then we could actually say that there is a very large time-varying effect. It goes from no effect to an effect across a given time-period. 

In these situations the best thing to do is to estimate and plot hazard rates or survival curves for fitted values of the variables. Unlike hazard ratios and first differences, these measures include estimated baseline hazards $h_{0}(t)$, which change at each point in time and effectively include information on time-period specific events. Plots of survival curves and hazard rates give us a sense of the variables' effects at each point in time. 

Correctly interpreting hazards that change over time takes both computational tools for estimating and graphically representing the functional form of these changes as well as a careful consideration of how study duration and historic time-period may affect them. We will look at some examples below to illustrate how researchers can accomplish this. 


%%%%%% Section: Modeling Strategy
\section{A Cox PH modeling strategy}

Before moving on to examples, lets combine these suggestions into one research strategy for examining phenomena with Cox PH models. The strategy has a number of steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine the covariates and covariate interactions to include in the model.
	\item Test for nonlinearity using splines and polynomials. Include splines or polynomials as needed.
	\item Test for violations of the proportional hazards assumption.
	\item If non-proportionality exists include time interactions.
	\item If non-proportionality still exists after including time interactions, consider another model that does not use the PHA. 
    \item Regardless of the EHA chosen, consider possible study duration and time-period specific biases.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%% Section: simPH
\section{\emph{simPH}: tools for simulating and graphing effects from Cox PH models}

One reason that researchers have inconsistently incorporated these suggestions is that there has been a lack of computational capabilities to implement them. In R the \emph{survival} and \emph{Zelig} \citep{R-zelig} packages have functions for estimating splines and time interactions. However, their capabilities for graphically showing results, especially over time, have been limited. Current capabilities for showing results from splines\footnote{Primarily R's \texttt{termplot} command. See \cite{Keele2008}, chapter 6.} do not simulate uncertainty in the way described earlier from Cox PH models. They also do not show how effects are estimated to change over time. In general the capabilities for showing results with time interactions is very limited. Usually, showing these types of results requires considerable researcher effort to extract estimates from model objects and then devise ways to show them graphically. See for example Licht's code for replicating the time-interaction plots in her paper.\footnote{It is available at: \url{http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/15633}.}

To solve these problems I am introducing the \emph{simPH} package for R.\footnote{See the Appendix for installation instructions and source code for the following examples.} There are three basic steps to use the package:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Estimate a Cox PH model using \emph{survival}'s \texttt{coxph} command,
	\item Simulate parameter estimates and calculate the relative hazards, first differences, hazard ratios, or hazard rates\footnote{Marginal effects can also be estimated for linear multiplicative interactions.} for a given parameter using the \emph{simPH} command corresponding to the variable type.\footnote{\texttt{coxsimLinear} can be used for linear, time constant variables, \texttt{coxsimInteract} for linear multiplicative interactions, \texttt{coxsimPoly} for polynomials, \texttt{coxsimSpline} for penalised splines, and \texttt{coxsimtvc} for time-varying coefficients.}
	\item Plot the simulations using the appropriate \emph{simPH} plotting command.\footnote{Commands include: \texttt{gglinear}, \texttt{gginteract}, \texttt{ggpoly}, \texttt{ggspline}, and \texttt{ggtvc}. These commands use \emph{ggplot2} \citep{R-ggplot2} and in some cases \texttt{scatter3d} from the \emph{car} packages \citep{R-car} to plot the simulations. You can use the simulation objects created by \emph{simPH} to make graphs with any other plotting package.} 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The simulation functions follow \cite{King2000} (discussed above) to simulate and calculate a variety of quantities of interest. The user can specify the number of simulations to run. The more simulations we conduct,\footnote{The \emph{simPH} default is 1,000.} the better picture we get of the probability distributions our parameters are from \citep[349]{King2000}.\footnote{Note that in some cases, such as with hazard rates with penalised splines, it is easy to ask the program to create more simulations than average desktop computers can easily handle. Therefore the user may need to balance a desire for a clear view of the probability distribution a quantity of interest comes from with what is computationally possible.} The plot functions then take these simulated values and plot them along with a smoothing line specified by the user to summarize their distribution's central tendency.

The functions in this package directly complement the strategy discussed in the previous section. They make it easy to interpret and present results without resorting to `train schedule' tables of coefficients and standard errors. Given that almost all of the quantities of interest, even hazard rates for single linear covariates, involve some interaction,\footnote{They created by multiplying the baseline hazard and the exponentiated coefficients and fitted values.} the `train schedule approach is a highly inadequate way to present results \citep{Brambor2006}. 

Most of the functions are capable of simulating and plotting hazard rates for multiple strata, i.e. when the baseline hazard is allowed to vary across different groups \cite[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2006}.\footnote{Currently \emph{simPH} does not present hazard rates for penalised splines from stratified models. This is mostly because of the difficulty presenting 4 dimensional results (i.e. time, hazard rate, fitted values of the variable, and strata.)} A stratified Cox PH model is given by
%
\begin{equation}
   h(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{k0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{(\mathbf{\beta X}_{i})},
\end{equation}
%
where $k$ is a `group'.\footnote{Currently, \emph{simPH} does not simulate uncertainty for the baseline hazard parameter estimate. Hopefully this will be included in future versions.} Groups can be defined in a variety of ways. One common use of stratification is to account for repeated event dependence \citep{BoxSteffensmeier2006}. An example of examining time-period specific biases in repeated event situations is whether or not a time-period specific idea may effect units that have already implemented one type of a policy in the past compared to units that have never had a similar policy. Stratified Cox PH models are particularly useful when examining time-period specific biases as it allows researchers to see if a common time period specific phenomenon effects these different groups differently. 

%%%%%% Section: Demonstrations
\section{Demonstrations}

To illustrate how \emph{simPH} can be used by political scientists, I will use it to replicate key figures and findings from \cite{Keele2010}, \cite{Licht2011}, and \cite{Gandrud2012, Gandrud2013}.

\subsection{Non-linear effects}

To demonstrate why researchers need to check for and explicitly model non-linearity \cite{Keele2010} replicated (among others) a study by \cite{Carpenter2002} on the time it takes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a new drug. He added spline fits to the variables in one of Carpenter's models. Then he used a Wald nonlinearity test to examine whether the model with splines had a better fit than the linear model. He then ran a Grambsch and Therneau test of non-proportionality for both the model with linear coefficients and splines. He found evidence that four of the variables in the linear coefficient model violated the test, whereas none of them violated the test in the spline model. This indicates that modeling non-linearity rather than time-varying effects is the more appropriate strategy. So, finally he built a model that kept the spline fits for the variables that the Wald test indicated had a nonlinear relationship and reintroduced the linear terms for the others. This allowed him to draw conclusions that, for example, the number of FDA review staff increases the likelihood that a drug will be accepted, but that the effect diminishes after a threshold number of staff are assigned. Also, counter to Carpenter's findings, the number of groups representing a disease has little effect on whether or not a drug treating it is approved once nonlinearities are accounted for. 

Previously it has been difficult to examine and communicate the functional form, magnitude, and uncertainty surrounding spline effects. Coefficient tables are very cumbersome, because a spline fitted effect is estimated using multiple coefficients and standard errors for values of a variable in a given range\footnote{The range is demarcated by ``knots''.} on the hazard. Depending on the size of the ranges\footnote{With R's \texttt{pspline} command the range can effectively be adjusted by changing the spline's degrees of freedom.} there can quickly be many more coefficients than can be efficiently presented in a table and understood by a reader. In his results tables, Keele does not show spline coefficients and simply denotes their overall significance with standard significance stars. In R you can plot--and Keele includes replication code to do this--the estimated spline effect over a range of values.\footnote{Again, this is done with the \texttt{termplot} command.} These plots, however, have a number of drawbacks. Firstly, the plots show the log hazard, which is not a particularly intuitive quantity to understand. It also plots standard errors, instead of the more widely used confidence intervals. Casual readers could easily think the uncertainty around the spline estimates is smaller than it really is.\footnote{Remember that the 95 percent confidence interval $CI$ for some point estimate $\hat{\beta}$ and standard error $SE$ is generally found with: $CI = \hat{\beta} \pm 1.96*SE$.} 

\emph{simPH} allows us to estimate quantities that we are more interested in like the relative hazards, hazard rates over time, as well as hazard ratios and first differences between different values of a variable for spline fitted effects.\footnote{If you prefer to model nonlinearities with polynomials, it also supports this. Though currently, it only estimates and plots relative hazards for polynomials.} For example, lets simulate the hazard ratios for the effect of the number of drug review staff on the time it takes for a drug to be approved. Figure \ref{Spline1} shows the simulated hazard ratios\footnote{See the Appendix for source code.} over the full range of FDA staff per drug trial observed in Carpenter's data.\footnote{The hazard ratios are for where $X$--FDA staff--are one unit apart.} Not only is this more informative than simply showing you the 12 coefficients and their standard errors that comprise the spline parameter estimates, it is also more informative than the current plotting alternatives in R, namely \texttt{termplot}.

Figure \ref{TermPlot} uses \texttt{termplot} to plot the log hazard of the effect and the standard errors. Apart from showing related but different quantities of interest, Figure \ref{TermPlot} gives us less useful information than Figure \ref{Spline1} about the probability distribution that the parameter is from. By only describing the distribution of the parameter with the mean value and standard error, Figure \ref{TermPlot} makes it difficult for us to know what the distribution is. Figure \ref{Spline1} simulates this distribution and shows it directly.

\emph{simPH} also allows us to plot hazard rates from spline estimates. This allows us to examine the possibility of any study duration or historical time-period specific biases.\footnote{Currently, \emph{simPH} cannot calculate hazard rates from stratified regression. Also, as a practical note researchers should carefully consider the number of simulations that they ask \emph{simPH} to make. It is very easy to attempt to draw many more simulations than the average computer can handle when finding hazard rates for spline estimates.} 

\subsection{Time-varying effects}

Though current capabilities for showing quantities of interest for splines are marginally improved by the simulation capabilities of \emph{simPH}, there are currently no easy to use ways to visually explore time-varying effects. As such \emph{simPH} substantially improves researchers' abilities to effectively show these results. To demonstrate this, I will recreate plots from \cite{Licht2011}.\footnote{As I mentioned earlier, she makes the Stata source code available. \emph{simPH} largely makes it much easier to implement these methods.} 

She re-examines Golub and Steunenberg's \citeyearpar{Golub2007} analysis of EU directive deliberation. Figure \ref{TVCQMV} recreates her figure showing the first difference of a log-time interaction for how the effect of qualified majority voting (QMV) legislative deliberation time changes as the number of days of deliberation increases \citeyearpar[see][236]{Licht2011}.\footnote{Her original figure was not in terms of a percentage difference to make it more comparable to a figure in Golub and Steunenberg's original. I present the results in terms of percentage difference, as the first difference is commonly reported. I have not separated out the pre and post Single European Act time periods for simplicity. There are slight discrepancies in the estimates presented in her figures and those here. These are caused by differences in how the underlying Cox PH model was estimated in Stata compared to R. Finally, I also examined whether or not nonlinearity functional forms would be better fits than time interactions as per our discussion above. However, I found no evidence of this.} We can clearly see that using QMV increases the probability of passing a directive, early in the deliberation process (almost by 300 percent at about 80 days in). But as the deliberation process goes on, the effect decreases and then becomes negative at about 1,000 days. The rate of decrease also levels off after 1,000 days relative to before. The code for how to recreate this graph is in the appendix. Needless to say, \emph{simPH} enables the graph to be made with only two lines of code, once the Cox PH model is estimated.

Figure \ref{BacklogRH} recreates the right panel of her Figure 3 \citeyearpar[][237]{Licht2011}.\footnote{One difference is that she estimates uncertainty from 10 draws of 1000 simulations, whereas Figure \ref{BacklogRH} is based on one draw of 1000 simulations.} This figure demonstrates the effect of different levels of legislative backlog\footnote{i.e. number of directives pending approval} on directive deliberation time from 1200 days after the directive was proposed. The effect shown here also is modeled as a log-time interaction. The main conclusion we can draw from this presentation of the log-time interaction is that if a piece of legislation is not passed in the first 1200 or so days from when it was proposed, it is less likely that it will be passed if there is a large legislative backlog \cite[for more details see][236-237]{Licht2011}.

\subsection{Time-period biases}

The examples we have looked at so far study phenomenon using generic rather than calendar time\footnote{\cite{Golub2007} do explicitly model particular time-period specific effects using dummies for whether or not legislation was proposed before or after the Single European Act.} and without examining how study duration may have affected hazard estimates. Let's now turn to look at how to examine these potential issues. Probably more so than with nonlinear and traditional time-varying effects accounting for study duration selection and time-period specific biases requires not only the use of computational tools like \emph{simPH}, but also a close reading of the underlying data and events surrounding studies' observation periods.

\paragraph{Study Duration Selection Bias in Deposit Insurance Choices}

In \cite{Gandrud2013} I used a Fine and Gray competing risks PH model to examined the reasons that countries created new independent deposit insurers. I used a sample of 70 countries from 1984 through 2007. With this sample I found that countries' level of democracy\footnote{Democracy was measured with the latent democracy scores found by \cite{Pemstein2010}.} had a time-varying effect on whether or not a country created an independent deposit insurer. By looking at the form of the linear time-varying estimates\footnote{These are not shown because \emph{simPH} does not currently support competing risks models. For the source code to create the time-interaction plots see \url{https://raw.github.com/christophergandrud/di-governance/master/commands/public_DI_replicible_tables.do}.} I found that democracy had a positive effect on adoption of independent deposit insurance before about the year 2000. After this point it had a negative effect, i.e. democracies were estimated to be less likely to adopt independent deposit insurance. What could explain this?

After a careful examination of the data, I found that only two countries with high democracy scores were still in the risk set after 2002: Australia and New Zealand. All of the other more democratic countries in the sample adopted deposit insurance by 2002 and were therefore removed from observation. These two countries can be treated as very similar as the major New Zealand banks are based in Australia. Deposit insurance choices for one country are highly related to the choices of the other. We can see how changing the sample's duration can effect this result. When I shorten the sample to just 1984 until 2000, the time-varying effect disappeared. If the sample was extended by a few years the effect may also have disappeared as the two countries introduced deposit insurance schemes on the same day in 2008.\footnote{New Zealand has since disbanded its program.} 

This example clearly shows how researchers using cohort studies should carefully consider how time-varying effects may be driven by study duration selection bias, rather than true duration effects.

\paragraph{Time-period Specific Bias}

In \cite{Gandrud2012} I used both Cox PH and Fine and Gray Competing risks to examine why 83 countries choose the type of financial supervisory governance that they did. One of the key hypothesis for why countries would choose to create a unified and independent supervisor is that the idea for such a system was heavily promoted by prominent international organizations and countries with important financial centers. This idea emerged and was heavily promoted from 1997.\footnote{This was the year that the United Kingdom created its unified and independent Financial Services Authority.} A competing idea that preceded this one was to have supervision governed by multiple regulators and the central bank, like the United States' divided system. This idea was promoted around 1990. In the paper I show how the level of promotion for this idea decreased overtime, especially following the introduction of the other.

All countries were exposed to these ideas at about the same times. So I predicted that the effect of mechanisms through which the ideas would diffuse--e.g. peer adoption and crises--would have a time-varying effect on regulatory design choices. Mechanisms with a positive effect on adoption of the US-style would have decreasing effects over the course of the sample (1988-2007). Mechanisms that positively effected adoption of the independent specialized system would have increasing effects from about 1997. 

I found that, as expected variables were predicted to have a positive effect when the US-style of governance was promoted did indeed have a declining time-varying effect on adoption of this style of governance. I determined this by using standard proportional hazards tests and graphing the combined coefficients. Interestingly, if the sample had looked at the 1980s through the early 1990s we would likely have seen these variables having an increasingly positive effect.\footnote{I unfortunately could not do this due to a lack of data in the early to mid 1980s} Using theory and a close reading of events I was able to have a more nuanced understanding of how the historic time-period specific events could be driving the time-varying effect estimates. 

I did not find similar violations of the proportional hazards tests for any variables in models looking at adoption of unified independent supervision. Can we conclude that these variables didn't have a time-varying effect? Such a conclusion is not necessary supported by the model and data. This is because before 1997 almost no countries created this type of supervision. When I graphed hazard rates over time (see Figure \ref{FinHR} for an example) it was clear that the variables were estimated to have had no effect on adoption before 1997. But, many of the predicted ideational diffusion mechanisms did have an effect on unified independent supervision in the direction predicted \emph{after} 1997. This provided evidence for an interaction between time-period specific ideational promotion and mechanisms that could make countries more receptive to adopting the ideas.

Figure \ref{FinHR} shows the simulated hazard rate for the effect of banking crises on countries with multiple specialized regulators creating a unified and specialized system. It was created using \emph{simPH}\footnote{See the replication code in the Appendix} and approximates Figure 4 from Gandrud \citeyearpar[20]{Gandrud2012}.\footnote{The original figure used a bootstrapping method implemented in Stata to approximate the hazard rates. This method does not show uncertainty surrounding the estimates. Note that for hazard rates \emph{simPH} currently only simulates uncertainty around the coefficient estimates, but not the baseline hazard.} We can clearly see that before 1997 (time 9 on the graph) having a crisis is predicted to have no effect on unifying multiple specialized financial supervisors. It's effect increases after 1997. This effect is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. This is exactly the time-varying effect we would expect to see based on theories that countries in crisis are more likely to adopt heavily promoted ideas as a way of overcoming means-ends uncertainty \citep[see][]{blyth2002,blyth2003,mcnamara1998,mcnamara2002,Windmaier2007}.

\end{figure} 

Though I did not find evidence of the time-varying effect I expected using standard proportional hazards tests, this does not mean there was no evidence for such an effect. Because of time-period specific events (or the lack of them) time-varying effects may exist but are only visible by plotting hazard rates over time and with careful consideration of the time-period that the sample is from.  

\section{Conclusion}

In this brief paper I have combined a number of important insights about how to build proportional hazards models into a strategy that will help researchers avoid common causes of model misspecification and misinterpretation. An important insight is that the multiplicative interactions and time-period specific biases researchers should look out for in their models may actually be factors political scientists are interested in studying. So we need tools to fully explore them. Doing this is often difficult with currently available software. So, I have also created and demonstrated a new R package--\emph{simPH}--that makes it considerably easier to effectively explore and present results from these models. 

\emph{simPH} is in the early stages of development, but more is on the way. In particular, it will be useful to add the ability to show results from interactions between different types of variables. For example, plotting quantities of interest from an interaction between linear and spline fitted variables. The package would also be more useful if future versions were capable of simulating and plotting results for models with frailties, i.e. random effects \cite[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2006}. There are also a number of computational efficiency improvements that could be made as well as adding the option to show traditional confidence bounds rather than the full number of simulation results. Finally, I hope to expand the package so that it is an effective tool for presenting results from other proportional hazards event history analysis models, notably the Fine and Gray competing risks model.
