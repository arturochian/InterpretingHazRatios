\noindent\emph{Draft version. Comments welcome.} \\[0.2cm]

Over the past decade Event History Analysis (EHA) has become a popular method in political science for examining cross-country cross-time data. However, most political science studies have not used EHA to its full potential. There has been an inordinate focus on effects averaged across time. Beyond issues of model misspecification, non-linear and time-varying effects may be substantively relevant for political science researchers. In particular focusing on time average effects ignores EHA's ability to examine how time-period specific events--such as global shocks or the promotion of new policy ideas--interact with traditional covariates. I argue that EHA can be used to examine the interactions between shared time-specific events, especially ``best practice" policy recommendations, and country-specific  variables. Make it easier for researchers to explore non-linear and time-varying effects, I introduce a new R package called \emph{simPH}.

\vspace{0.3cm}

Recent articles in \emph{Political Analysis} have highlighted two frequently overlooked sources of model misspecification misinterpretation in the popular Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model \citep{cox1972}. \cite{Licht2011} discusses how to model and interpret covariate effects that violate the proportional hazards assumption. \cite{Keele2010} points out that un-modeled non-linear relationships in Cox PH can bias results. In addition, \cite{Hern'an2010} recently published a short article in \emph{Epidemiology} entitled ``The Hazard of Hazard Ratios". He highlighted two common problems with the way that hazard ratios (HR) are often interpreted. He argued that researchers ignore (1) how hazard ratios  change over time and (2) the fact that their studies' observation periods have ``built-in selection-biases". Though he was focusing on epidemiological research, time-period specific biases are a potentially important issue for political scientists to address, especially when interpreting time-varying effects. 

The Cox PH model and Event History Analysis (EHA) in general is increasingly being used to address political science questions. A small sample of recent studies using Cox PH and EHA includes: \cite{Aleman2011, BuenodeMesquita1999, brooks2005, Gandrud2012, Gates2006, Golub2007, Jordana2005, Mccubbins2009, Neumayer2002, Simmons2006}. As the Cox PH model has become more prevalent in political science we need better strategies and tools for avoiding the problems that \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{Keele2010}, and \cite{Hern'an2010} identify.

My aim in this paper is to lay out a strategy and computational tools for addressing these problems. In the first part of the paper First, I briefly summarize Licht, Keele, and Hern\'{a}n's arguments. Second, combine them together into a singe strategy for researchers using Cox PH models. Solutions to all of these problems are particularly amenable to solutions that use graphically presented estimates. Third, I introduce a new R \citep{RLanguage} package--\emph{simPH} \citep{R-simPH}--that includes tools for graphically exploring time-varying and non-linear Cox PH estimates and estimation uncertainty. I illustrate \emph{simPH}'s capabilities with both simulation data and data from recent political science research.

%%%%%% Section: Common issues
\section{Common issues in analysis with Cox PH models}

In this paper I focus on one of the more commonly used EHA models in both political science, the Cox Proportional Hazard Model \citet{cox1972}.\footnote{In general my conclusions also apply to Fine and Gray's \citeyearpar{Fine1999} Competing Risks Model which is a Cox PH analogue for competing risks EHA.} The CPH is a semi-parametric EHA model that allows researchers to examine how specified factors influence the rate of a particular event happening--a policy is adopted, a government falls, or a war breaks out--at a particular point in time given that the even has not already occurred.

This rate is commonly referred to as the hazard rate ($h_{i}(t)$).\footnote{It is given formally by: $h_{i}(t) = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\mathrm{Pr}(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \leq t)}{\Delta t}$, where $T$ is .} The hazard rate for unit $i$ at time $t$ is estimated with the CPH model using: 
%
\begin{equation}
    h(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{(\mathbf{\beta X}_{i})},
\end{equation}
%
where $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard, i.e. the instantaneous rate of a transition at time $t$ when all of the covariates are zero. $\mathbf{\beta}$ is a vector of coefficients and $\mathbf{X}_{i}$ is the vector of covariates for unit $i$.

We are usually interested in how a covariate changes the rate of an event happening. For example, does having a majoritarian electoral system increase the probability of a country adopting a given policy? In general researchers have tried to answer these questions by looking at the CPH coefficient estimates $\beta$. Like logistic regression, the coefficient is more easily interpreted if we examine its exponent $\exp(\beta)$, i.e. the hazard ratio (HR). Using the HR we can find the predicted percentage change in the hazard rate when we compare two values of a given variable. To find how the effect on the hazard rate of some value $X_{1}$ compared to $X_{2}$ with a coefficient $\beta$ we use the following formula from \citet[60]{boxsteffensmeier2004}:
%
\begin{equation}
    \%\triangle h(t) = \left[\frac{\mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{1})} - \mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{2})}} {\mathrm{e}^{(\beta X_{2})}}\right]
\end{equation}   
%
There are a number of possible sources of model misspecification that can bias our coefficient estimates and our substantive interpretations

\subsection{Non-proportional hazards}

One of the most common sources of estimation bias in Cox PH models discussed at length by \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{BoxSteffensmeier2001}, and \cite{boxsteffensmeier2004} are violations of the proportional hazards assumption (PHA). The PHA is that the hazards of two units experiencing an event are proportional to one another and that this relationship is constant overtime. Formally, for the PHA to hold the hazard of units $j$ and $l$ then:
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{h_{j}(t)}{h_{l}(t)} = \mathrm{e}^{\beta\prime(X_{j} - X_{l})}.
\end{equation}
%
If the PHA is violated and measures are not taken to correct for the violation, then researchers may obtain biased parameter estimates and statistical tests with lower power \citep{Therneau1990,Keele2010}. Beyond these statistical problems, not adjusting for violations of the PHA can obscure phenomenon that political researchers are particularly interested in finding.

\cite{Licht2011} identifies a important political science theories that actually lead us to expect that the PHA will be violated. She says ``the nature of the political processes of learning, institutionalization, strategic developments, and information transmission \ldots are likely to produce frequent violations of the PHA'' \citeyearpar[228]{Licht2011}. In particular, building on \cite{Finnemore1998} and \cite{blyth1997} researchers have attempted to empirically examine how ideas may affect policy change and diffusion relative to geopolitical and domestic political and economic factors, among others. An important empirically observable difference between these types of theories is how they predict the effects of specific factors \emph{will change over time relative to others}.\footnote{Note that the effects of variables in Cox PH can change overtime without violating the PHA via a change in the baseline hazard. We will look at this issue in more detail later in this section.} For example, the effect of norms and ideational diffusion mechanisms \citep[see]{Yee1996} are predicted to strengthen overtime. Whereas the effect of most domestic political and economic and geopolitical factors are expected to have a constant or perhaps decreasing effect overtime \citep[228]{Licht2011}. It is likely that more than one of these approaches has an effect of any given political event of interest. Therefore we should expect that some of our covariates will violate the PHA because their effects on the hazard of an event change non-proportionally over time relative to one another. Properly modeling how covariate effects change overtime is crucial for 	adequately testing our hypotheses. 

There are a number of widely used tests to examine whether or not the PHA is violated. See \cite{Grambsch1994}, \cite{BoxSteffensmeier2001}, and \cite{boxsteffensmeier2004} for discussions of various methods of testing the PHA.\footnote{Many common software packages implement versions of these tests. R's \emph{survival} package \citep{R-survival} implements Grambsch and Therneau's \citeyearpar{Grambsch1994} modified Schoenfeld residuals test. This is done with the \texttt{cox.zph} command.} If a covariate is determined to violate the PHA, Box-Steffensmeier and co-authors \citep[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2003,boxsteffensmeier2004} suggest directly modeling the relationship between the variable and time. This usually entails including an interaction between the variable and some function of time such as the natural logarithm or some exponent.\footnote{The decision to use a particular functional form should be guided by theory and will likely influenced by findings in the data.} If $f(t)$ is some function of time then a simple Cox PH model estimating the hazard rate for unit $i$ with one time-interaction is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
	h_{i}(t|\mathbf{X}_{i})=h_{0}(t)\mathrm{e}^{(\beta_{1}X_{i} + \beta_{2}f(t)X_{i})}.
\end{equation}

Like any other interaction effect \cite[see][]{Brambor2006} extra care should be taken when interpreting the parameter estimates. We cannot simply interpret the effect $X$ by looking at $\beta_{1}$ or $\beta_{2}$ in isolation. Licht's argues that postestimation simulations techniques that should be employed to understand these time interactions. She describes two methods: (a) first difference and (b) relative hazards. The first difference is the percentage change in the hazard rate at time $t = t$ between two given values of $X$:
%
\begin{equation}
	\%\triangle h_{i}(t) = (e^{(X_{j} - X_{l})(\beta_{1} + \beta{2}f(t))} - 1) * 100.
\end{equation}
% 
Relative hazards\footnote{The term was advanced by \cite{Golub2007}.} are given by:
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{h_{j}(t)}{h_{l}(t)} = \mathrm{e}^{X_{j}(\beta_{1} + \beta_{2}f(t))},
\end{equation}
%
where $l = 0$. It represents the change in the hazard when $X$ is ``switched on'' as it would be when comparing an European Union member to a non-member, for example.

Relative hazards are particularly useful for binary variables because they reflect the change in the hazards between $X = 0$ and $X = 1$. The first difference can be more useful for continuous variables as changes in $X$ from 0 to 1 may be inconsequential or even impossible when we are looking at, for example, the effect of GDP per Capita. In these cases the first difference will be more appropriate. Though the choice between relative hazard and first difference can be cosmetic. They are the same if $X_{j} - X_{l} = 1$.

Following \cite{King2000}, Licht argues that simulation techniques make it easy to estimate the uncertainty surrounding the first difference and relative hazards. In both cases we first find the the parameter estimates for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ and $\hat{\beta_{2}}$ from a Cox PH model as well as the variance matrix $\hat{V}(\hat{\beta})$. Second, we draw $n$ values of $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ from the multivariate normal distribution given by $\hat{\beta} \sim N(\hat{\beta}, \hat{V}(\hat{\beta})$. Third, we use these simulated values to calculate either the first difference or relative hazard for a range of times $T = [t_{1}\ldots t_{T}]$, specified values of $X_{j}$, and $X_{l}$ (as appropriate).

Using these simulation techniques allows us to estimate the full time-varying effect, how it changes over time, substantively asses the effect, and show the uncertainty surrounding our estimates.
 
\subsection{Non-linear Effects}

Time-varying coefficient effects are not the only cause of PHA violations. Building on \cite{Grambsch1994} and \cite{Therneau2000}, \cite{Keele2010}\footnote{See also \cite{Keele2008} chapter 6.} points out that common diagnostic tests will as indicate PHA violations if the model is misspecified for other reasons. Omitting an important covariate, using a proportional hazards model even if another EHA model is more appropriate, or including a covariate as linear when its effect is actually non-linear will also lead to significant PHA violation tests. 

Because of this Keele suggests that \emph{before} testing the PHA we should (a) try to make sure that we are not omitting important variables, (b) find the appropriate functional form for the covariates, typically either polynomials or splines. Many studies using Cox PH models have not test for nonlinearity, but instead jumped straight to testing the PHA, including time-interactions when it violated. As Keele \citeyearpar{Keele2010} demonstrates ascribing a time-varying effect to a covariate when in fact the effect varies not over time, but non-linearly over values of the covariate can have major substantive implications.

After omitted variables and non-linearities have been addressed, then (c) we can then test for the PHA. If it is violated we can add time interactions as before. If after doing all of these steps non-proportional hazards are still present then he suggests we should look for an EHA model, such as the log-logistic model--that does not assume proportional hazards.

\subsection{Time-period specific biases}

\todo[inline]{Haven't looked at the baseline. Effects common to all units.}

The last major issue involves the interpretation of hazard ratios, regardless of whether the effect is non-linear, time-varying, or not, without reference to time. \cite{Hern'an2010} highlights two problems with interpreting hazard ratio's without reference to time. These are:
%
\begin{description}\label{Marginal}
  \item [{\textbf{Problem 1:}}] Hazard ratios are averaged over the study's observation period;
  \item [{\textbf{Problem 2:}}] Time period-specific HRs have an inherent selection-bias. 
\end{description}

\noindent Starting with Problem 1, hazard ratios are the estimated effects of variables on the hazard rate averaged over a study's particular observation period. Equation 2 gives us a variable's time-averaged marginal effect. The value of time-averaged HRs depend on a study's duration and be influenced by the length of the study. As with any mean value, HRs may in fact be large at one point in the study and then small in another. Presenting just time-averaged HRs does not reveal these trends.   

Let's consider how this works in Cox Proportional Hazard models. CPH does not have an intercept. It does have a baseline hazards $h_{0}(t)$. Note that baseline hazards change at each point in time ($t$). Unlike in linear regression where the intercept can be ignored when interpreting estimated marginal effects, we need to consider both hazard ratios and the baseline hazard at each point in time to understand what is going on. The best way to present hazard ratios is by comparing survival curves or hazard functions using fitted values over our studies' observation periods. These graphs give us a sense of the variables' effects at each point in time.

If hazard ratios can change at each point in time, then a study's specific observation period can effect our results. Hern\'{a}n largely focuses on what I call \emph{duration period-specific selection-bias} (PSSB). 

For example, imagine that we are interested in whether or not a country adopted a policy P ($\mathrm{P}=1$). We create a simple EHA with one independent variable $X$, such as democracy. We test the model on twenty years worth of data. Imagine that the averaged hazard ratio from this model is positive--higher values of $X$ increase the hazard of adopting policy P. When we look at the HR over time we find that in the first ten years of the observation period the HR is positive then becomes weakly negative for the last decade. 

What causal story could explain this? Duration PSSB may be at work. There could be a proportion of countries in our sample that are more likely to adopt policy P when they also have a positive value of $X$, because $X$ is interacting with some unobserved factor Z to produce a common effect C. Using epidemiological terminology, these countries are more `susceptible'. Over the course of the observation period, the more susceptible countries adopt policy P at a higher rate than countries that just have high values of $X$. After the susceptible countries exit the risk set, we are left with a sample of less susceptible countries. $X$ in the absence of Z may actually have a slight negative causal effect, which we observe after the susceptible countries drop out of our sample. 


%%%%%% Section: Modeling Strategy
\section{A Cox PH modeling strategy}

We can combine these suggestions into one research strategy for those setting out to examine a phenomenon with Cox PH models. It has five steps:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Determine the covariates and covariate interactions to include in the model.
	\item Test for non-linearity using splines and polynomials.
	\item Test for violations of the proportional hazards assumption.
	\item If non-proportionality exists include time interactions.
	\item If non-proportionality still exists after including time interactions, consider another model that does not use the PHA.
	\item If there is no longer evidence of non-proportionality examine time-period specific biases.
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%% Section: simPH
\section{\emph{simPH}: tools for simulating and graphing effects from Cox PH models}

Previously, there have not been a full contingent of capabilities to implement this strategy. In R the \emph{survival} and \emph{Zelig} \citep{R-zelig} packages had capabilities for estimating splines and time interactions. However, their functions for graphically showing results has been limited. Spline functions did not simulate uncertainty in the way described earlier from Cox PH models. though you can use the \texttt{termplot} command to plot log hazards with corresponding confidence bounds for splines.\footnote{See \cite{Keele2008}, chapter 6.} \emph{Zelig} can simulate and graph parameter values, but not for combined time-interactions. In general the capabilities for showing results with time interactions is very limited. Usually, showing these types of results requires considerable researcher effort. See for example Licht's code for replicating the time-interaction plots in her paper.\footnote{It is available at: \url{http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/15633}.}

To solve these problems, particularly for time-interactions, I am introducing the \emph{simPH} package for R.\footnote{See the Appendix for installation instructions.} There are three basic steps to use the package:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Estimate a Cox PH model using \emph{survival}'s \texttt{coxph} command,
	\item Simulate parameter estimates and calculate the relative hazards, first differences, or hazard ratios for a given parameter using the \emph{simPH} command corresponding to the variable type.\footnote{\texttt{coxsimLinear} can be used for linear, time constant variables, \texttt{coxsimPoly} for polynomials, and \texttt{coxsimtvc} for time-varying coefficients.}
	\item Plot the simulations using the appropriate \emph{simPH} plotting command.\footnote{Commands include: \texttt{gglinear}, \texttt{ggpoly}, and \texttt{ggtvc}. These commands use \emph{ggplot2} \citep{R-ggplot2} to plot the simulations. You can use the simulation objects created by \emph{simPH} to make a graph with any other plotting package.} 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The simulation functions follow \cite{King2000} (discussed above) to simulate and calculate a variety of quantities. The user can select specify the number of simulations to run. The more simulations we conduct, the better picture we get of the probability distributions our parameters are from \citep[349]{King2000}.\footnote{The \emph{coxPH} default is 1,000.} The plot functions then take these simulations and plot them along with a smoothing line specified by the user to summarize their central tendency.

The functions in this package directly complement the strategy discussed in the previous section. With the few exceptions discussed before, without \emph{simPH} researchers would implement the strategy, but would find it difficult to actually interpret their results beyond simply presenting ``train schedules'' of coefficients and standard errors. Given that almost all of the quantities of interest, even hazard rates for single linear covariates, involve some interaction, the ``train schedule'' approach is a highly inadequate way to present results \citep{Brambor2006}. 

Most of the functions are capable of simulating and plotting hazard rates for multiple strata, i.e. when the baseline hazard is allowed to vary across different groups \cite[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2006}. This is particularly useful when examining time-period specific biases as it allows researchers to see if a common phenomenon effects different groups differently. ``Groups'' can be defined in a variety of ways. One common use of strata is to account for repeated event dependence. An example of examining time period specific biases in repeated event situations is whether or not a time-period specific idea may effect units that have already implemented one type of a policy in the past compared to units that have never had a similar policy. 

%%%%%% Section: Demonstrations
\section{Demonstrations}

To illustrate how \emph{simPH} can be used by political scientists, I will use it to replicate key findings from \cite{Licht2011}, \cite{Keele2008}, and \cite{Gandrud2012}.

\section{Conclusion}

In this brief paper I have combined a number of important insights about how to build proportional hazards models that avoid common causes of model misspecification. These multiplicative interactions and  time-period specific biases may be factors political scientists are interested in. So we need tools to fully explore them. As this is often difficult in current software, I have also created and demonstrated a new R package--\emph{simPH}--that makes it considerably easier to effectively present results from these models, especially results that are the result of complex multiplicative interactions. 

\emph{simPH} is in the relatively early stages of development, but more more is on the way. Functions for spline simulation and graphing are noticeably lacking in the present version, but will be added in the coming months. It will be useful to add the ability to show results from interactions between different types of variables. For example, plotting quantities of interest from an interaction between a linear and spline fitted variable. The package would also be more useful if future versions were capable of simulating and plotting results for models with frailties, i.e. random effects \cite[see][]{BoxSteffensmeier2006}. Finally, I hope to expand the package so that it is an effective tool for presenting results from other proportional hazards event history analysis models, notably the Fine and Gray competing risks model.
